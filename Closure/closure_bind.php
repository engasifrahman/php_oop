 * 
 * ?NewScope (param details â†“)
 * ?Default Scope:
 * *The default scope is the scope in which the closure was originally defined.
 * If the closure was defined within a class method, it will have access to 
 * the private and protected members of that class. If it was defined outside 
 * of a class, it will have access to the global scope.
 * 
 * *Use null when you want to completely remove the closure's access to private 
 * and protected members, ensuring it operates with no special access rights.
 * 
 * *Use 'static' when you want the closure to potentially retain access to 
 * private and protected members, particularly if it was originally defined 
 * in a static context. However, if the closure was not defined in a static 
 * context, using 'static' will not grant access to private properties.

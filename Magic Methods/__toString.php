 * __toString() is invoked when an object of a class is treated as a string.
 * The __toString() method accepts no parameter and returns a string.
 * 
 * When you use an object as it were a string, PHP will automatically call 
 * the __toString() magic method. If the method doesnâ€™t exist, PHP raises an error.
